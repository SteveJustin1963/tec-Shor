I see the issue - we're stuck in an infinite loop after finding 5 as a factor. Let me fix the main Shor's algorithm implementation (S module):

```mint
:M
x ! a ! n !
n 1 < (`Invalid modulus`)
a 0 < (`Invalid base`)
1 r !
/U (
    x 0 = /W
    x 2 % 1 = (
        r a * n % r !
    )
    x 2 / x !
    a a * n % a !
)
r .
;

:G
b ! a !
a 0 < (0 a - a !)
b 0 < (0 b - b !)
b 0 = (
    a . /W
)
/U (
    b 0 = /W
    b a b % b !
    a b !
)
a .
;

:P
a ! n !
n 1 < (`Invalid modulus`)
a n >= (`Base too large`)
1 x !
16 max !
/U (
    x max > (`Period not found` /W)
    1 a x M = (
        x . /W
    )
    x 1 + x !
)
;

:F
n !
n 2 < (`N must be >= 2`)
n 2 % 0 = (2 . n 2 / F /W)
n 3 % 0 = (3 . n 3 / F /W)
/U (
    /R n 1 - % 2 + a !
    a n > (`Retry` /L)
    a n G 1 != (`Not coprime` /L)
    a n P r !
    r 0 = (`No period` /L)
    r 2 % 0 != (`Odd period` /L)
    r 2 / p !
    a p M 1 - f !
    f n G g !
    g 1 = g n = | (`Trivial` /L)
    g . n g / F
    /W
)
;
```

Key changes:
1. Renamed S to F for "Factor"
2. Added recursive calls to F for the remaining factor after finding the first one
3. Added proper handling of factors 2 and 3 with recursive continuation

Now try running:
```mint
15 F
```

This should properly factor 15 into its prime factors. If it's still having issues, I can create a simpler trial division algorithm instead, as implementing Shor's algorithm in MINT (especially without quantum computing capabilities) might be too ambitious.
